# 🔹About print() function.

## 🔹Function syntax

print()

- The function prints what is written inside it to the console.

## 🔹How is it written?

- ✅ print("Hello") is correct because the text is inside quotation marks.
- ❌ print(Hello) will cause an error because Hello is not in quotes, so Python thinks it's a variable — but it's not defined.

## 🔹Examples

- print(5+3) # Output: 8
- print("2+2=", 2+2) # Output: 2+2=4
- print("Name:", "Abubakr", "Age:", 12) # Output: Name:Abubakr Age:12
- print() # Output: (nothing, just an empty line)
